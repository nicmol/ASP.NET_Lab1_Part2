           I started this site to plan better Thanksgivings with family and friends.<br /> 
        Instead of one person trying to coordinate everything themselves,<br /> on Potlucky 
        everyone can share in the planning together.<br /> I wanted a place to plan potlucks where everyone 
        can see the dishes that are being brought<br /> and coordinate dates, times, and places through.
